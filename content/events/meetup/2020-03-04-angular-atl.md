EVENT DETAILS:

"GraphQL: What's all the fuss anyway?" by Josh Oppenheim

GraphQL is already being used by many teams of all sizes to clearly and efficiently get applications precisely the data they need from potentially many APIs. Together we'll learn the basics of GraphQL - What it's for, what benefits it could bring to your app, when you should use it, and how to incrementally incorporate GraphQL into your organization's tech stack. Then we'll dive into an example "Tour of Heroes" Angular app that's been rewritten to use GraphQL and Apollo instead of the default REST HttpClient.
