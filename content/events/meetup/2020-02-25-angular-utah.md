Rogelio Flores - PWAs + Angular

No, we're not talking about politics when we talk about Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). We will be talking about how to create your own PWA, and what tools the Angular ecosystem provides to make it easier for you to create them. PWAs aim to provide a user experience on web apps similar to native apps. Specifically, PWAs should provide offline rendering and offline-first storage, app-like installation, besides being responsive. In other words, the web app "progressively" becomes more and more similar to a native app, depending on the capabilities of the platform the app is running on (latest modern browsers will offer the best experience).

Shaine Berube . - Ngx-Dynamic-Forms

Ever wondered how those plugins you use are built and how to make something that anyone can reuse? Ever wondered how to get your code to be more reusable? Well, look no further, in this meeting we will be going over some guidelines, tips and tricks that Shane has picked up, as well as showing you a new open-source NPM project that he's been working on called Dynamic Forms. Dynamic Forms is a project that allows programmers to define the configuration and structure of the form in two objects, then inject the data into a single importable component for dynamic form generation and then sit back and watch the form be built on the fly! And you can even add or remove form controls dynamically instead of having to build separate forms and work some crazy magic! Come and learn some guidelines and principles of abstraction in Angular.
