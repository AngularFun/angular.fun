1️⃣ My journey into mobile and how I fell in love with Ionic

I was an only developer at a company that had to do lots of native android and iOS apps and there's only so much you can do. 10 years ago I discovered hybrid web apps and this changed everything for me.

2️⃣ Rethinking Cross-Platform

🇬🇧 Remote talk in english

Building "cross-platform" apps is often a loaded term. With previous experiences defining how people think about the subject. But times have changed, and so has our technology for building cross-platform. In this talk, we'll look at Capacitor, a new way to build for iOS, Android, and most importantly the web, all with one codebase.

📢Mike Hartington: Mike is a developer, Angular GDE, and Ionic Developer Advocate who’s been working in the mobile landscape for most of his professional career. When he’s not working Ionic itself, Mike works with community members and helps them succeed at mobile. In his spare time, he’s an aspiring woodworker, occasional musician, and craft beer lover.
